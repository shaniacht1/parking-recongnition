# parking-recongnition
This repository contains my Bachelor's project for empty parking lot recognition from video footage

# Pre-processing
Receives a folder of indicative sample photos from the selected parking lot (different days, hours, seasons etc.)

# Post-processing
Receives a photo of the current parking lot  state and the results from the `Pre-processing` step. Outputs an image  marking the available parking spots.
Green - available
Red - taken
Orange - probably taken
